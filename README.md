## ✅ Week 7 Tasks
This week's assignment focuses on getting started with **TypeScript** and working with **generic functions**.
- Installed TypeScript and set up a new project.
- [x] Created a generic function that accepts an array of any type and returns the first element.
- [x] Used appropriate **TypeScript annotations**.
- [x] Configured a working `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation.
- [x] Ran and tested the function using `ts-node`.
