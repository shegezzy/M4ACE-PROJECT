### ✅ Week 1 Tasks
- Initialized a Git repository.
- Created `hello.txt`, copied it to `week2` as `hello_copy.txt`, and deleted the original.
- Wrote a short paragraph in `about_me.txt` using Vim.
- Pushed the project to GitHub.

### ✅ Week 2 Tasks 
- Practiced cloning the repo and added `goals.txt` with programming goals.

### ✅ Week 3 Tasks
- Wrote a function to calculate the sum of two numbers.
- Created a program to print “Hello, World!” and log the current date.
- Built a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
- Developed a function to find the largest number in an array.

💡 “Small steps lead to big achievements — keep coding!” 🚀

### ✅ Week 4 Tasks
- Implemented Separation of Concerns (SoC) by organizing code into different modules.
- Created a Promise-based API function to simulate API responses.
- Used the OS module to log system information.
- Printed a welcome message from Node.js.
- Created an object to represent a student with name, age, and grade.
- Implemented a function to greet the student by name.

💡 "Clean code is easy to read, debug, and maintain!" 🚀

### ✅ Week 5 Tasks
- Implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by creating a class named ClassRoom.
- Used JavaScript classes and constructors to initialize objects with specific properties.
- Ensured Separation of Concerns (SoC) by structuring files properly.

💡 "The best way to learn to code is to build, break, and fix. Keep pushing forward!" 🚀

### ✅ Week 6 Tasks
- Implemented a function to filter even numbers from an array.
- Used `.reduce()` to calculate the sum of numbers in an array.
- Flattened a nested array using ES6 array methods.
- Created and manipulated a TypedArray (`Uint8Array`).
- Converted a regular array to a TypedArray and back.

🚀 "Every line of code is an opportunity to learn something new."


### ✅ Week 7 Tasks
This week's assignment focuses on getting started with **TypeScript** and working with **generic functions**.
- Installed TypeScript and set up a new project.
- [x] Created a generic function that accepts an array of any type and returns the first element.
- [x] Used appropriate **TypeScript annotations**.
- [x] Configured a working `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript compilation.
- [x] Ran and tested the function using `ts-node`.

🚀  "Every expert was once a beginner – TypeScript makes JavaScript more powerful, one type at a time."

### ✅ Week 8 Tasks
- Created a Node.js script to write “Hello, File System!” into a text file.
- Built another script to read the file content and print it to the console.
- Practiced using fs/promises and working with asynchronous file operations.
- Resolved CommonJS vs ES module compatibility by using import instead of require.

💡 "The filesystem is the soul of the machine — learn to write to it and you'll master it!" 🛠️

### ✅ Week 9 Tasks
- Created a module to export a function that calculates the area of a rectangle.
- Imported the module into another file and used it to calculate and display the area.

🚀 "Modularity isn't just a practice, it's a mindset — one function, one job!"

### ✅ Week 10 Tasks
- Built a basic **HTTP server** using Node.js.
- Server responds with “Welcome to My Server!” on access via browser or `curl`.

💡 "The web starts here — every great backend begins with a simple server!" 🚀

### ✅ Week 11 Tasks
- Extended the HTTP server to handle multiple routes: `/`, `/about`,`/me` , and `/contact`.
- Used separation of concerns by structuring route handling into separate modules.

🚀 "Good code structure today prevents bugs tomorrow. Stay modular, stay clean!"

### ✅ Week 12 Tasks
- Created an Express.js server that responds with "Hello, Express!" at the root route /.
- Practiced setting up and running a basic Express app.
- Gained experience with Node.js package management (npm init, npm install express).

🚀 "With Express, building servers becomes simple and scalable — keep growing!"

### ✅ Week 13 Tasks
This week's focus was on **Routing in Express**:

- [x] Defined a root route (`/`) that returns a welcome message.
- [x] Created a dynamic route `/user/:id` to display user ID.
- [x] Handled query strings in `/search?q=keyword` with appropriate conditional responses.
- [x]  Added a /books route that returns a list of books as a JSON array.
- [x] Maintained Separation of Concerns by splitting routes into individual files (`userRoutes.js`, `searchRoutes.js`).

💡 "With Express, routing becomes smooth and powerful — like GPS for your server!" 🚀


### 🛢️ MongoDB Connection
- Installed MongoDB Node.js driver.
- Created a `.env` file to securely store the `MONGO_URI`.
- Connected the Node.js app to **MongoDB Atlas** using the URI.
- Logged a success message when the connection was successful, and handled connection errors gracefully.
